Feature: In order that I know when a formula is incorrect I want to be notitified of circular references

Scenario: Cell references itself
	Given a sheet with data:
	 | Row | A   |
	 |  1  | =A1 |
	Then an error notification is received

Scenario: 2 cells reference each other
	Given a sheet with data:
	 | Row | A   |
	 |  1  | =A2 |
	 |  2  | =A1 |
	Then an error notification is received

Scenario: Cell references a cyclical reference
	Given a sheet with data:
	 | Row | A   |
	 |  1  | =A2 |
	 |  2  | =A1 |
     |  3  |     |
	When the values are changed:
	 | Cell | Value |
	 | A3   | =A2   |
	Then an error notification is received
